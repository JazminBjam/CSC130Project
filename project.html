    <h3>Environmental Exploration Vision Statement: </h3>
	<p>"Inspiring people to explore their physical environment
	through the help of extended reality. Our goal is to provide the suitable applications needed to expand 
	accessibility for people with disabilities and mobility struggles while allowing the same access to 
	beautiful hidden landscapes in their area."</p>

	<div id="whatpart">
	
	<p> 2D: Our website shows a map of different activities based on the physical environment. 
		The map shows a general overview of each area based on your location.<br><br><br>
		3D: Once hitting a specific pinpoint for a location, users can see 3d images of the 
		locations and explore before actually going.</p>
	</div>
	
	<button onclick="myFunction2()"><h4> What is the hypothesis?</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="hypothesis">
	<p> Using extended reality within the physical environment can lead to greater accessibility 
		for exploring the natural world.</p>
	</div>
	
	<button onclick="myFunction3()"><h4> Why is this idea important?</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="ideaimportant">
	<p> People spend a lot of wasted time looking for nice hiking spots, hidden beachs, and 
		artifacts. Having this application would aid in time efficiency and planning, as well as
		having a more inclusive accessibility needs, such as wheelchair accessibility, elderly, or
		mobility issues.</p>
	</div>
		
	<button onclick="myFunction4()"><h4> Using XR emotionally to immerse the user?</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="emotionally">
	<p> Focusing on the lack of accessibility for people wanting to explore the physical
		environment, as well as focusing on using the 3D feature at home for an individual
		to access their own needs before exploring the specific location.</p>
	</div>	
	
	<button onclick="myFunction5()"><h4> Three reasons why this idea is or is not good for XR.</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="goodforXR">
	<ul>
		<li> Pro: Able to use at home on a mobile phone</li>
		<li> Pro: Easier to visualize</li>
		<li> Con: Need a base knowledge for technology, additional technology programs, and 
		how to use it which could be harder for elderly</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<button onclick="myFunction6()"><h4> Three reasons why this idea is or is not better in 3D.</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="betterin3D">
	<ul>
		<li> Pro: 3D allows for a better understanding of the area compared to photos</li>
		<li> Con: Harder to code and program </li>
		<li> Con: Need resources and be able to go to the location before to create in 3D</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
		
	<button onclick="myFunction7()"><h4> AR, MR, and VR possibility </h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="possibility">
	
	<ul>
		<li> AR: A general basis on what the locations look like in 3D, able to use on phone.</li>
		<li> MR: More in depth and able to interact for a deeper understanding of location.</li>
		<li> VR: If unable to visit the physical environment location, can still visit through 
			virtual reality.</li>

	<div id="projectin3d">
	<p> Going to the locations in the environment from your technology at home, better understanding
	of terrain</p>
	</div>

	<button onclick="myFunction10()"><h4>Design principles for hypothesis</h4></button><br><br>
	<div id="designprinciples">
	<ul>
		<li> Useful: Going to the locations in the environment from your technology at home, better 
		understanding of terrain.</li>
		<li> Usable: The design needs to focus on interactive map apps in VR and how this would be
		implemented into the app.</li>
		<li> Desirable: People can gain checkpoints and goals with the more locations they visit as 
		well as uploading photos and comments.</li>
		<li> Valuable: Greater enjoyment for the people within the community, allowing people with 
		disabilities to explore the natural world with interest and risk-free.</li>
		<li> Findable: Having an interactive map of the locations as well as directions to the place.</li>
		<li> Accessible and Inclusive: Being able to explore the app at home and assessing your own needs
		before leaving for the location</li>
		</ul>
